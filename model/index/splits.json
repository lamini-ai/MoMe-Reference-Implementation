According to SS-C101_6 - Earthworks and drainage, Section 14.5, geotextiles are to be tested by the supplier for the design parameters at a rate of full suite of tests every 5,000 m2 or batch per requirement specified in Section 13.1.9. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to ensure that all geotextiles delivered to Site comply with the design specifications. This testing frequency is important to ensure the geotextiles meet the required design parameters and perform effectively in the intended application. Geotextiles are commonly used in earthworks and drainage projects to improve the mechanical properties of soils, prevent soil erosion, and enhance the stability of embankments and slopes. Regular testing of geotextiles for design parameters helps to maintain the desired performance and longevity of the geotextile-reinforced structures. The testing methods permitted for geotextile testing include MASW (Multi-Antecedent Statistical Analysis of Wave Number Spectra) on building pads constructed with cement stabilised fill, UPV (Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity) Testing of core samples recovered from drilling of the material, and other advanced test methods determined by the Project Technical Representative. In summary, geotextiles should be tested for design parameters every 5,000 m2 or batch as per the requirements specified in SS-C101_6.

This testing frequency is important to ensure the geotextiles meet the required design parameters and perform effectively in the intended application. Geotextiles are commonly used in earthworks and drainage projects to improve the mechanical properties of soils, prevent soil erosion, and enhance the stability of embankments and slopes. Regular testing of geotextiles for design parameters helps to maintain the desired performance and longevity of the geotextile-reinforced structures. The testing methods permitted for geotextile testing include MASW (Multi-Antecedent Statistical Analysis of Wave Number Spectra) on building pads constructed with cement stabilised fill, UPV (Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity) Testing of core samples recovered from drilling of the material, and other advanced test methods determined by the Project Technical Representative. In summary, geotextiles should be tested for design parameters every 5,000 m2 or batch as per the requirements specified in SS-C101_6. Regular testing ensures the geotextiles meet the required design parameters and perform effectively in the intended application, contributing to the overall success and longevity of the earthworks and drainage projects. 0.2928834551602073"}, {"input": "90.
